# [`Deftu's Download Counter`]
Modrinth and CurseForge download milestone tracker!

</div>

## What is it?

A Discord bot which tracks milestones in your mods' download counts on both Modrinth and CurseForge.

## Can I use it in my server?

Yes! But... You'll need to self-host it, as I would get in hot water with CurseForge/Overwolf if I were to host it myself for all.
